Normalization Explanation:


For all tables:

-All table cells hold a single value (1NF)

-All values are unique, with the Rentals table only referencing other tables using foreign keys and all tables have a primary key (1NF)

-All data types in the tables are consistent (1NF)

-All tables have no partial dependencies by using a primary key in each (2NF)

-All table attributes are dependent on one key only and have no other dependencies (3NF)


All tables in the database meet 3NF criteria listed above, which includes meeting all 1NF and 2NF criteria. 
This removes redundant data and features, and ensures integrity of the database.
